# Vanilla javascript accordion

[JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/jonathanbrincat/c1h6487k/171/)

## Introduction
Simple UI example with absolutely no embellishments. Although not stringent would still sematically comply with accessiblity standards. Although a positive enhancement would still be further refinement of accessibility criteria; assignment of the appropiate ARIA metadata; defining keyboard interactivity according to WAI-ARIA guidelines.

A further possible enhancement would be to incorporate auxilary classes to transition state so these can be tracked and flagged in stylesheets.

## Usage

```javascript
new uiAccordion(".ui__accordion");
```

Note you can choose to prescribe the suggestive markup or not however the node hierarchy must be preserved for obvious reasons.
